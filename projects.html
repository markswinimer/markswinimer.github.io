      Nerd Words is a word library creation web application developed using Ruby on Rails, ReactJS, and a PostgresDB. Nerd Words allows users to create digital word libraries to use in place of physical ones with games like Pictionary and Taboo. Initial web app was created over the course of two weeks to encapsulate what I learned at Launch Academy. With the minimum viable product being achieved in the two weeks, I now plan to refactor and add robust tests to my code.

      Eatalike is a restaurant review website I developed with a team of four in two weeks in two weeks. The project was an exercise in practicing web development as part of a team while using Agile methodology and git version control. Eatalike is designed to be a restaurant review website that encourages users to leave meaningful feedback on the atmosphere and experience of a restaurant rather than a single rating.
